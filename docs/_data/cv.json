      "highlights": [
        "Led testing of Dexcom's next generation wearable platform from POC to V&V handover.",
        "Led small team using NUD/ECO and risk-based approach to prioritize and execute characterization, cliff, and reliability testing at component and system level.",
        "Test planning, p-diagrams, risk register, documentation etc.",
        "Developed tests...",
        "Developed equipment...",
        "Electro-mechanical debugging of complex wearable systems. Worked as part of several mission-critical 'Tiger Teams' to find and prove root cause on issues such as Environmental Stress Cracking, Adhesive Delamination, Rapid Voltage Decline/Brown-outs, Battery Electrolyte leakage, and other product performance related issues.",
        "Developed Windows software for NFC communication and test specimen preparation and tracking, DUT data parsing and automated analysis using SAS JMP API including normalization and filtering, chart generation, distributions, T-tests, etc.",
        "Developed novel methods and semi-automated equipment for attaching 0402 passive SMD components to end of 0.25mm dia. coax wire to emulate specific test loads, without the use of solder or significant thermal exposure. ",
        "Measurement routines and fixtures",
        "Instron method and fixture development, including advanced uses of strain input to capture dynamic analog electrical data from DUT, and Digital I/O to trigger and sync external measurement equipment such as DMM, Oscilloscope, or SMU during compression/tensile/shear testing.",
        "Highly skilled with use of optical microscopes and physical tools such as scalpels, tweezers, soldering irons, hot-plates, alongside CAD/CAM systems such as bench-top milling machines, 3D-printing, automated epoxy and adhesive dispensing equipment, to dissect and debug devices, prepare novel device configurations for test, and enable rapid prototyping of small electro-mechanical devices.",
        "Use of embedded systems to enable high-n testing with limited expenditure, e.g. recording data to SD card from many sensors on a shared I2C or SPI bus, logging current, voltage, temperature, humidity through various environmental conditions. Development of a small form-factor multi-sensor BLE enabled PCBA to measure temperature, ambient pressure, humidity, condensation droplet formation inside a thumbnail sized enclosure.",
        "Developed POC for MongoDB database integration into test flow and equipment such as LabView test beds, custom windows software, to demonstrate benefits of centralized data storage and access across R&D test teams, enable dashboarding and automated reporting and documentation on platforms such as Confluence."
